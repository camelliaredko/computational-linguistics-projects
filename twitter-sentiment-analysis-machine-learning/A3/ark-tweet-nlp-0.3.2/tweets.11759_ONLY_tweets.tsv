@MmmBaileys Happy birthday, Jess!
@ModelMandyLynn My current favourites are Life, House and formerly Boston Legal. I guess I enjoy sarcasm
@Monhae Quite tearful today, but I laughed a lot also. To put it simply.
@mony_ bonjour, Wii is more fun
@moonfrye I find your tweets are extraordinarily and consistently positive. Given my own last tweet, I could take a page from your book.
@Morrica This is very true. But, there's work to be done and if I napped all day like I want to I'd never sleep tonight!
@mortonfox Every time I see your TwitVim tweets, I feel the need to use twit.el.
@mozunk you can do that. just go hover over the tweet in the favorites, then tweet, then favorite. it will unfavorite it.
@mrBallistic Very true. Lack of Adobe Apps = focus. Depends on what you do, though. Browser alone could be a distraction
@MrRobbyM LMFAO I DO Ah, lastnight was epic &lt;3
